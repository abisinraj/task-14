# Task 14: Linux Server Hardening (Fedora)

**Project Summary**
This project documents the hardening of a Fedora Linux server to reduce its vulnerability surface. I performed a full system update using `dnf`, configured **firewalld** to drop unauthorized traffic, and secured **SSH** by disabling root login and enforcing key-based authentication. Additionally, I removed unused users and services to strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege.
